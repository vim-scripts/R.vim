Fernando Henrique Ferraz Pereira da Rosa is now a coauthor of this plugin (starting from version 0.03). He helped me fixing a bug and started the syntax file for mixed highlighting of Latex and R syntax (syntax/rnoweb.vim).

I set up a small project page for this plugin, featuring a screenshot:

You can browse the subversion repository where these files are at home: http://kriemhild.uft.uni-bremen.de/viewcvs/?root=vim

Alternatives for Mac Os X include vimscript #1741 and vimscript #2104.

Under Windows, I am now using a quite simple solution, consisting of the installation of the rcom package for R which requires statconnDCOM from http://rcom.univie.ac.at and ActiveState Perl in the PATH (watch out if you use R tools, because GNU perl does not have the DCOM interface, so ActiveState perl needs to be first in the path).
My ftplugin/r.vim under Windows:

perl << EOF
sub rsourceclipboard
{
    use Win32::OLE;
    my $R = Win32::OLE->GetActiveObject('RCOMServerLib.StatConnector')
          || Win32::OLE->new('RCOMServerLib.StatConnector');
    $R->Evaluate("source('clipboard', echo=TRUE)");
    $R->Close;
}
EOF

vnoremap <buffer> r "*y:perl rsourceclipboard<CR>

This means that the visual selection is pasted to the clipboard and the clipboard content is sourced by R when the key "r" is pressed in visual mode.
